# Customer Manager Project

### Description

This is a simple CRUD app with ReactJS. It uses the Context API and reducers for the state management and Firebase for the database and authentication.

This app is made purely for skill showcase purposes. It could be boiled down to something a lot simpler. That being said, the use of state management made it easier to implement the back-end so it's not so bad.

### What I've Learned

- Organizing the codebase really does make it a lot easier to implement something.
- Check the original documentation first before using a third party lib as sometimes the original way is better.

### Possible Improvments

- Use async-await in all the promise-based functions.
- Get rid of the react-firebase-hooks lib.
- Add form validation.
- Add other authentication methods.
